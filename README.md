# CreeperExplosionAvoidance

## Description
this is a simple plugin to avoid the block damage to creeper explosions, that's it.  
  
I built this plugin because the effect of disabling the game rule "mobGriefing" can result in 
misbehaviour in e.g. villager farms, there were already plugins but these had too much configuration
options 

## Installation
Download the Plugin from the Releases Tab or Spigot and put it in the "plugins"-Folder of your Server Directory

## Compatibility
I tested the plugin on 1.8.8 and on 1.19 and both worked, so all Versions between should work too.
